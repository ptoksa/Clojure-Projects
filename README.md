This repository contains various Clojure and ClojureScript projects, including both backend and frontend applications. The projects are designed to showcase different aspects of Clojure development, from simple algorithms to full-stack web applications.

## Projects

- **Calculator ClojureScript App**: A simple calculator app built with ClojureScript.
- **CRUD App**: A basic ClojureScript app demonstrating CRUD operations.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe ClojureScript App**: A web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with ClojureScript.
